# Pulic-Grevience-System

In general, we come across many problems in society or in a community. But, no one takes any initiative
to raise a complaint regarding the issue. So, to solve this problem we are introducing an online portal
for public grievances. Anyone logged in to the portal can easily file a complaint on any issue prevailing
in the community or society. The complaint can be anything such as uneven roads, drainage leakage
problems, water wastage problems, emergencies, corruption scenes, crime scenes, garbage problems
and other public problems. When a complaint is registered then the respective authorities are informed
about the issue through a message or an email with respect to the choice of the authorities and the
customers. Here, there are three main roles- Admin, Authorities and Users. Admin can view all the
activities that are been going on regularly. Every role has a different interface in communicating with
the portal. Admin and users can view the status of the complaint filed and the authorities can update the
status. Admin has the privilege to cross-check the updates done on each complaint and if necessary, can
take some action against the authorities, if the complaint is not taken seriously. Users can also provide
a review on the authorities based on their interest in solving the problems, the duration is taken to solve
the problem/issue etc. A warning notice will be sent to the authorities if the problem is not solved in the
time given by them. Admin creates a list of complaints filed and complaints solved by each authority
and a detailed review every month/week and publishes in the portal. The details of the user can be
anonymous based on the interest of the respective user.
